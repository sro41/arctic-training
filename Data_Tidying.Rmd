```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```
To call a funtion from a specific package 'package_name::function_name(...) This is in the case of overlap in objects per the above error message

# Data Cleaning
```{r}
catch_df<- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", 
                        method = "libcurl"),
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(catch_df)
```

The above code allows reading in data from a url. `read.csv(file =)` sometimes doesnt work on windows, the above code fixes the error.

`libcurl` forces the default library to make a connection with an https:// URL. Dependent on operating system.
